- Interviewer
    Thank you for participating in the first place. A few more questions just to gather the last info we need. How was it playing the blindfolded version compared to the unblindfolded version? Did you notice any difference in your approach to the game?
- Player 1
    I found it easier because I was not influenced by his moves.
- Interviewer
    Okay. So in playing unblindfolded you were letting yourselves be influenced?
- Player 1
    SÃ¬.
- Player 2 
    Yes because I was trying to figure out what she would do.
- Interviewer
    Okay from what? Trying to wait for the other person's move or looking into the other person's eyes?
- Player 2
    From the eyes. No no, looking at her.
- Interviewer
    Okay. Well then before you actually tried the blindfolded version did you have any expectations that it might have been easier, harder, more entertaining?
- Player 1
    Boh, I personally thought that blindfolded maybe more difficult also because I couldn't actually see my hands, so maybe coordination, I'm kind of uncoordinated.
(general laughter)
- Interviewer
    Okay, and do you think that anyway being blindfolded has affected your game performance? In the sense do you get better or worse? Regarding the final results.
- Player 2
    I don't think it got better or worse but I felt more confident blindfolded.
- Player 1
    That's right, same thing.
- Interviewer
    Okay perfect. Last question: what was your favorite part of the system, considering the different parts so the sounds, the speakers, where the sensors were placed, the sensors themselves...
- Player 2
    The sensors and speakers I think.
- Player 1
    The speakers, sensors and sounds...
- Player 2
    Yes yes, the sounds!
- Interviewer
    What about the least favorite part? Something maybe that can be changed?
- Player 2
    Sensors 
(laughs)
    I didn't understand anything about how... 
(general laughter)
- Interviewer
    Okay, in the sense that it was hard to reach or not?
- Player 2
    No no no, I simply did not understand whether I should leave it all the time or take it off.
- Interviewer
    Okay, it was not clear from the beginning. So ideas on how to improve? Any advice possibly? Anything is fine and feel free.
- Player 1
    Maybe instead of the sensor press a button? I don't know...
- Interviewer
    Okay, would it be more immediate? Even simpler?
- Player 2
    Yes, yes!
- Interviewer
    Okay is it okay anything else to add?
- Player 2
    No, it was nice!
- Interviewer
    All right, thank you very much for your participation!
- Player 2
    You are welcome!
