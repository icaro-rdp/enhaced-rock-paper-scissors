    Thank you for participating! So, how was playing the Blind version of the game compared to the non-Blind version, and did you notice any particular changes?
- Player 1
    The Blind version is much more engaging, and, for some reason, much more intuitive. It was easier for me to remember to cover the sensor, and I focused more on the sounds. In the version with eyes open, I was much more distracted by the other player, by  the system: looking at the glove, taking pictures, and so on. Yeah, many more things.
- Player 2
    I agree with him 100%. For some reason, with eyes open, I had to think about more things, whereas when my eyes were closed, I had fewer things to think about, and it was easier for me.
- Interviewer 
    Before trying the Blind version, when you were told that you would play it, did you have any expectations? Did you think it would be easier, more difficult, more intuitive, or less intuitive?
- Player 1
    I was afraid I wouldn't find the sensor (the one to start), but I found it immediately instead.
- Player 2
    I didn't have any particular expectations, honestly.
- Interviewer
    Do you think being blindfolded influenced your performance or approach to the game?
- Player 1
    So, I can say that I was more focused on the game. Whether that concentration was positive or negative for a good result is yet to be seen.
- Player 2
    I agree with him to some extent. I don't think it influenced my performance, but it definitely affected my mental state, which might have indirectly influenced my performance even if I'm not aware of it.
- Interviewer
    What was your favorite part of the system and least favorite part in its various components and parts?
- Player 1
    Overall, I liked the system. In the Blind version, I found the audio feedback gratifying because I was waiting to know whether I had won or not, and the tactile feedback didn't help me as much; I was waiting for the audio (the sound of the move I made).
- Player 2
    I also think that the sound part was done very well, and above all, it was genuinely enjoyable. It felt like it was designed with purpose. The only thing missing perhaps was some cue to remind you to put your hand on the sensor because I always forgot that (especially with eyes open). A sound resembling the one the sensor makes when you put your hand on it, or even a voice saying "new game," could be helpful.
- Player 1  
    Speaking of positive aspects, I find the tone of the speaker's voice very engagingâ€”very American, like a sports game. I really like it.
- Player 2
    And the tactile feedback worked only to a certain extent. It's something I was thinking about just now, I don't know if it's related to the previous question: one thing I noticed about the difference between playing with eyes open and playing with eyes closed is that when you play with eyes open, you make your move and immediately know the result, whereas in the game with eyes closed, there's a moment of suspense while you wait that adds a certain pleasant anticipation.

    Some tips for improvement?
- Player 1
    Something to remember to put your hand on the sensor and something about the sensor placement: for example, it could be having the sensor on the other hand and making a gesture. In the Blind version, going to find the sensor is easy but not comfortable, in the sense that you don't know where you are (maybe putting it on the opposite wrist).
- Player 2
    And also the issue with the glove: it's a bit uncomfortable having to put it on and take it off delicately.
