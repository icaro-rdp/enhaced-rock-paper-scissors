- Interviewer
    Ah, thank you for participating, first of all. The last three questions. Just a few additional notes. Maybe first I ask one of them, first I ask you, but the question will be the same. What was it like to try the blind version of the game, without sight? Compared to the normal one and if you have noticed any change between one and the other.
- Player 2
    Yes, I noticed that on the blind one, that is, I took longer to think about the answer. Because, in fact, I couldn't see what the other person was answering and... nothing... More fun, though, is the blind one.
- Interviewer
    What about you?
- Player 1
    I also had to, that is, I stayed thinking more about every move I made, trying to anticipate those of the other. Rather than the one without the bandages in which I pulled a little by feeling, a little...
- Interviewer
    OK more to feeling, understood. OKOK, then, we told you that there would be two modes. OK from the start, so before you actually tried it, did you have any expectations? Do you think that being blindfolded has affected your results or how you approach the game?
- Player 2
    Namely... Me, I didn't know what to expect really. And it has changed, in my opinion yes, even in an unconscious way, perhaps, but yes, that is, not seeing, in my opinion it has actually changed my, my behavior, my responses.
- Player 1
    Expectations yes, none in particular. But yes, having then managed both, the second, the one without being able to see. Much more. It put more into the game.
- Interviewer
    OK? Well, last. What was your favorite and least favorite part of the system: gloves, sounds, or using the distance sensor to register or being blindfolded and unblindfolded? Your favorite and least favorite feature.
- Player 1
    Then the best in my opinion are the sensors that recognize then with the audio systems that says player one, player two.
- Interviewer
    OK.
- Player 1
    The least preferred. Or maybe the fact that, in general. If this thing wanted to be done by several people, maybe the glove can't fit on everyone.  Maybe that's the feature I can say. But for the rest...
- Player 2
    Yes, me. Well, yes, the least favorite, perhaps, gloves. Because I had to keep, that is, I wanted to keep an eye, not... Don't break them or anything.
- Interviewer
    OK.
- Player 2
    My favorite, here it is... The system knew how to recognize my answers, such as the sounds it emitted, depending on itself, I saw a stone, scissors, something. I know, I liked that one.
- Interviewer
    Any advice on how it could be improved? Anything is fine, in its various aspects.
- Player 1
    I think if I got my hands on it, I'd only make things worse. So I can't help there, but I can say that it's a very cool thing in my opinion, that is, if actually people stopped and followed you to take these two steps, and to spend this quarter of an hour. That is, I was in my room, doing nothing. (laughter)
- Interviewer
    You've done something new. Oh well, nice.
- Player 1
    And nothing. Now I have a story to tell...
- Interviewer
    It's very pleasing, good, good.
- Player 2
    Yes, no. In fact, there's the fact that these experiments are usually a bit boring. For mine, for my course, I have to do a couple and they say they bore you. But this was interesting, that is, a lot of fun. In fact, yes, yes. Loved it.
- Interviewer
    Well, well, it's very nice, OK a few more comments, more things to add. If you want, otherwise... in place. Thank you very much.
