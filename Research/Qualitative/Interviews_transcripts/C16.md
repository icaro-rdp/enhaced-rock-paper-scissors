    Thanks for participating first of all, to both. So, the first question I will ask you, about the experience you had is: how did you feel playing blindfolded compared to not being blindfolded, so in the two different versions. Did you feel any differences? Any particular changes in how you approach the game or how the experience was? 
- Player 1
    I mean, to me, I think when you… when you play blindfolded you… like your moves are more random, you don't think too much and when you are seeing, you try to… I mean I try to think a bit more to what my opponent will do. 
- Interviewer
    Okay.
- Player 2
    Yeah, same for me and also if you are playing blindfolded you can feel everything and you… even if it’s… there is no sounds in the speaker, you can know you are winning or losing in some confident…
- Player 1
    Yeah, you pay more attention to the vibrations 
- Player 2
    … to the vibrations!
- Interviewer
    When you are blindfolded?
- Player 1
    Yeah!
- Interviewer
    Okay, okay. More concentrated on that, I see. So, before playing blindfolded, did you have any expectations on how the experience could have changed, for example? Do you think it changes your performances as well?
- Player 1
    For me personally, I have no expectations. Uuum… I just thought that it would be more fun, yeah more fun. 
- Interviewer
    More fun ok, easier, harder or … ? 
- Player 1
    Just more fun!
- Interviewer
    okay 
- Player 2
    Yeah, there was no expectations, just …
(laugh)
    I mean it’s just a game, so...
- Interviewer
    Yeah, it’s fine. Of course, of course, of course, don’t worry. Okay, so last question: what was your favorite part of the system, considering audio, feedback or the gloves themselves… 
- Player 2
    The gloves… 
- Interviewer
    The gloves? Okay you liked how… 
- Player 2
    Cause I… feeling my moves and also interacting with my hands and recognizing my gestures, it was so fantastic!
- Interviewer
    Okay! 
- Player 1
    Yeah, the thing is for me is when you're playing blindfolded, the best thing is that you can know if you won or not even if you don't see the move of your opponent. So like the interaction between the audio and the vibrations is quite good answer.
- Interviewer
    Okay, and list the favorite features, feel free to say anything.
- Player 1
    Uuum voices
- Interviewer
    The voices?
- Player 1
    Yeah, the voices are cool, remind me of vintage arcade games!
- Interviewer
    Yeah, and the least favorite? So, something that you dislike or you have suggestion to improve in the system.
- Player 2
    I really didn’t know… umm I really didn’t understand the sensors.
- Interviewer
    Yeah, it was to start the game, basically…
- Player 2
    Ahhh I got it…
- Interviewer
    … To be easy to find and have reliable way to start game by game every time
- Player 2
    So I say it was so easy to use…
- Interviewer
    Easy or not?
- Player 2
    Easy, yeah! 
- Interviewer 
    Okay 
- Player 1
    Yeah, the same for me, it was easy. Maybe another feature would be… I don't know… some lights when you're playing not blindfolded… yeah that's it basically. 
- Interviewer
    Of course, of course. Okay, some more comments if you have… otherwise I will interrupt.
- Player 1
    I’m okay! 
- Interviewer
    Okay! Perfect, thanks again.
