    So first, thank you for participating for the experiment. And the first question we need just three more information from you. I will ask, how did you feel in playing the blind version of the game compared to the not blind one? And the differences you noticed, if there are.
- Player 1
    OK, I like more the blind version. It was, for me it was more funny. And the the difference with the vibration was really amazing. Like to know the…
- Interviewer
    To know who is winning?
- Player 1
    Yeah, exactly. So yeah, OK.
- Player 2
    For me, honestly, it was a bit distracting to have my… I mean, in both ways. Why? Because when I was blindfolded, I was trying. I was, I think, intellectualizing too much. And I was thinking, like: how the vibration are different for the scissors, for this, for that. And I was so I was focusing on the other stuff, elementary stuff, instead of this. However, I think it was more interesting when blindfolded. Because it makes you really think about what the opponent is thinking and try. Yeah. So, I was thinking a lot. And also, I think it was a bit distracting to have the vibration. There is latency, like, after you do the move, it takes a long time to vibrate. So, it would be, I think. It would be, I don't know the purpose, but I think it would be, for me, maybe more helpful to have the… Because it's like, I do this, (showing a move) for example. Then I wait for the vibration.
- Interviewer
    The vibration is for Win. Like if you win or if you lose you get a difference it's not for the moves. So, you would suggest to have the vibration also for the different symbols. OK.
- Player 2
    OK, cool. And for the… When I was not blindfolded, I felt… Like there was, I was… I mean, it's not very precise because I could see what she… I tried not to cheat! I promise!
(everyone laughs)
- Interviewer
    But you have the same opportunity to, in some ways. Of course, you can't, you wouldn't have been allowed to play a move and then change it. But still, you had the same opportunity to wait a bit before the opponent moves arrives.
- Player 2
    Exactly, that's true. Through. Yeah, like I think, like if I… If we both wanted to, we could. Win by cheating.
- Interviewer
    Then it's a matter of who cheat best, OK.
- Player 2
    Exactly. The overall experience is really nice.
- Interviewer
    OK, so you knew you would have played both modalities since the beginning. Before actually playing them, did you have any expectation on which one would have been easier? Which one would have been more interesting for you? Before actually trying. Any expectations? Yeah.
- Player 1
    For me, it's really the blind one would be more interesting because, like… I played Scissor Rock before, but not blinded.
- Interviewer
    OK, makes sense.
- Player 2
    I… I honestly don't know. I don't know. But for me it's very interesting because I, I watched this anime that I, I also recommend.
- Interviewer
    Which one?
- Player 2 
    It's called Kaiji. It's super. It's about this game. All of it is about this game and it's I mean, sorry, I'm going to drift away but this guy basically has a huge debt. You need to know about. That he didn't know about at all. And then in order to win a lot of money to pay that debt, he had to to go gambling and gambling was on a huge ship. It's either you die or survive. And then you have to play this game for the entire anime. So, I really recommend it maybe to give you some insight.
- Interviewer
    We will take a look. OK. And did you think… Do you think that playing blindfolded affected your results and your performances in the game?
- Player 2
    Yeah, it it made it more neutral.
- Interviewer
    OK, OK.
- Player 2
    For me, at least.
- Player 1
    Yeah, I think the same.
- Interviewer
    OK. OK, nice. So for the last part, what was your favorite part of the system? So sound, gloves or the distance sensor and what was your least favorite one? Feel free.
- Player 1
    I like more the idea of the gloves that we need like to wear gloves and to see like our hands movements and the sounds. Yeah, the least favorite part maybe… That every time we need to play we need to scan the... [IR sensor] Yeah, that's it.
- Interviewer
    OK.
- Player 2
    Yeah, I really agree on the second point, I mean also maybe a timer would be more helpful like 3-2-1 and then we both do it.
- Interviewer
    Ok so not, do that every time.
- Player 2
    Yeah, not having to do this. Yeah, not we need. And there was. I really like the feature like: “player one”. You know, it reminds me video games. Yeah, it's super, super. 
- Interviewer
    They are from video games.
- Player 2
    It's super cool. I like everything about it. I also liked how it makes you more sensitive to how you move, basically.
- Interviewer
    I see. OK. We would be a bit more careful. Yeah, I see. OK, so recommendations about how to improve something you already answered more or less, but: timer and that feature [IR sensor]. OK, good. We finished. If you have anything else to add, feel free.
- Player 2
    Ohh, good luck. This is very promising, no? Really good job though.
- Interviewer
    Thank you. Thank you.
- Player 2
    I hope, even if you don't get enough participants. I hope you enjoy it.
- Interviewer
    Should be fine. Thank you.
