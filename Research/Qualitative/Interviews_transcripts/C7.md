- Interviewer
    So, thank you for participating, first of all. The last information we need, I ask you verbally, and, answer freely. So, first question: what was it like to play blindfolded, compared to the normal play? Without bandages, have you noticed any differences?
- Player 1
    Well, playing blindfolded, in my opinion, was easier because you can more or less understand what a person wants to do better.
- Interviewer
    Better than not blindfolded OKOK.
- Player 1
    Yes, yes.
- Player 2
    I think it's the other way around, despite losing both times. But, oh well, it's just not a game I play a lot, but, I think it's easier, if you really want to study a game, to understand the person unblindfolded.
- Interviewer
    OKOK then? There are advantages to playing unblindfolded. OK. Before you actually tried the two modes, when you knew you had to play them separately, did you have any expectations? An easier one, a more difficult one? One with advantages, one with disadvantages?
- Player 1
    I don't, honestly.
- Player 2
    Me neither.
- Interviewer
    Did you expect it to improve or worsen your gaming performance? Okay, you didn't expect any particular changes. Finally, the preferred and least preferred part of the system is the most important part of the system, in the various components. And if you have any tips to improve.
- Player 1
    Well, the system, maybe the feedback it gave you when you lost or win.
- Interviewer
    OK, positive or negative? 
- Player 1 
    Positive. And maybe negatively. You know, I don't…
- Interviewer
    Ok
- Player 2
    I agree with feedback, the first thing I thought of is haptic feedback, when you lose or win. I don't know what I would improve, maybe having a sensor where you press, without having anymore... Without having these extra things.
- Interviewer
    More, more immediate. Ah, OK, yes yes, yes, it fits. Anyway, was it hard to find it? The sensor. Ok, any more comments? Some more details? If you want to add… otherwise... All right? Thank you for participating.
