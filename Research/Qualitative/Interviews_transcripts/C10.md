    So, hope you enjoyed the experience. It was fine. So, the first question is: how did you feel like playing in the blind version compared to the not blind one? Did you notice any particular change in switching between the modes?
- Player 2
    So, if you talk about like: seeing the other player, of course I couldn't maybe see what the, what face was the other player making and maybe like the ability to predict what the other player was doing it’s a little bit lower, not so much, but yeah.
- Interviewer
    Yeah, I mean. OK.
- Player 1
    While I was playing blind version it just was random. Yeah, I couldn't read like the body language or the other person. And yeah, while playing, vice versa on blind, I could feel more pressure.
- Interviewer
    More?
- Player 1
    More pressure, because I understood. OK, I should calculate his next step.
- Interviewer
    OK, OK. See, did you have any expectation before actually trying the different modes when we told you would have played blindfolded, did you have any expectation of what could have been the effect?
- Player 1
    No, I don't think so for… No.
- Player 2
    So, for me it was quite new experience to play blind, so it was like... Strange, never played blind.
- Interviewer
    OK. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't happen every day. Yeah. Do you think being blindfolded affected your game performances where you better in one or the other? 
- Player 2
    I think yes a little bit.
- Player 1
    Yes, I think not in blind version you can perform better.
- Player 2
    OK. Or at least you can like… Mmmh… You have the feeling to be, more in control of the situation, yeah.
- Interviewer
    In the not blind OK. Yes, yes. OK. Last question. What was your favorite part of the system? And the least favorite? Favorite part I mean the…
- Player 2
    Maybe like the sensor, when I was blind was quite difficult to find it.
- Interviewer
    OK, I see that could have been improved that could be improved. OK.
- Player 1
    What I like is the vibration and the sound.
- Interviewer
    OK, OK.
- Player 1
    And that’s all… I liked everything.
- Interviewer
    OK. Thank you. So, any recommendation on how to improve? Yeah, the sensor could have been made differently, but that's fine. OK.
- Player 1
    Maybe a little bit faster like the player one is ready OK.
- Interviewer
    Yeah. OK. Making it shorter. I see it. OK. Any last comments, some, some last things to say? Otherwise…
- Player 1
    I like that. Yeah. 
- Interviewer
    What, what?
- Player 2
    The vibration, the vibration, yeah.
- Interviewer
    You like. You like them? Nice. Nice to know. Thanks for participating.
