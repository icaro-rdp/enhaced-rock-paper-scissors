    I will ask the last questions I will ask you to answer on voice. So, first of all, thank you for participating again. The final questions are… We just start with the first one, first you can answer, and then we'll switch to you. So, how did you feel playing the blind version of the game compared to the not blind? If you notice any particular change, please report them OK.
- Player 1
    For the blind one, I thought it was easier to, kind of predict the… What she was going to do because there were no other distractions. I could really just think. Whereas in the. Like visual test, I was like second guessing myself more and as it went on I… I didn't do as well. Thanks.
- Player 2
    OK, could you repeat the question?
- Interviewer
    Right. Yeah. Yeah. So how did you feel playing the blind version of the game compared to the not blind one? If you notice, any changes?
- Player 2
    Right. I noticed that like in the blind version, you can play it fairly. You cannot analyze and predict what someone other is going to do. Yeah, in the blind version. And in unblind versions we can predict versus someone going to be signed. And this, so, this is the change which I want…
- Interviewer
    So, you mean predicting not by thinking about the previous moves, but by looking at the fingers before they are actually displaced? OK. OK, nice. Thank you. So, you knew you would have played the two versions before actually playing them. Before that happens, before you tried the two versions, did you have any expectations on the differences or on how it could have gone? So, if you want to start, you have any expectation before actually playing blindfolded about the differences or how it would have been? 
- Player 2
    No. I haven’t really…
- Interviewer
    OK, that's fine. Still fine. Good. You?
- Player 1
    I thought that the blind one would be very… Not random, but just would be kind of inconsistent, more like very… It wouldn't be a strategy, it would just be kind of seeing what happens. Whereas with the visual I thought it would be more of an actual game.
- Interviewer
    OK, OK. And in the end, it was not like that, or?
- Player 1
    In the end, I think it was the opposite for me because I was trying to strategize more in the blind one. Whereas the visual I was kind of, just playing.
- Interviewer
    OK. Thank you. So, you think it affects your game performances, how you play rock, paper, scissors. I know that the rules are not that hard. Yeah, I know, I know. But you think it affects the way you played? 
(laughs)
- Player 1
    Yes
- Interviewer
    Same? Or not…
- Player 2
    For the blind one. Yeah, like. It's a little bit hard for you what's going around you, like analyzing thing. This is a bit weird, but overall, I think the blind one is much better if you are see the “fairism” of the game. So, it's…
- Interviewer
    OK. OK. Thank.
- Player 1
    You have to change the way you think. Like I really had to switch the strategy.
- Interviewer
    I see. OK, thank you. So, last question, what was your favorite part of the system, considering the several parts or gloves, sound system or distance sensor? And what was your least favorite one? And then if you have any recommendation about how to improve some of them.
- Player 1
    I liked the sensor because sometimes when you're playing it's like some people go on the third one or go like… It's kind of inconsistent… Whereas this one tells you when to do it. It's fairer and that's it. I liked it.
- Interviewer
    OK, so having it… Having it like… yeah… controlled by the system, the counting, and not by one of the player, make it more fair. Yeah. OK, I see.
- Player 2
    But in my point of view, I find everything is very well and it's organized well.
- Interviewer
    OK. OK, any recommendations or suggestions? Anything goes.
- Player 1
    Good. I like the sound effect.
- Interviewer
    OK. OK, thanks. OK, nice to. Nice to know. So, thanks. Thanks for participating as well.
