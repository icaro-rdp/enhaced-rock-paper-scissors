    I started the recording. Thank you for participating, first of all.  Just a few final pieces of information we need. So, the first question: how was it to play the Blind version of the game (without sight) compared to the one with sight? Did you notice any differences?
- Player 1
    Yes, I found it more enjoyable because I couldn't see the answer, and I had to wait for the vibration to know if I had won or not.
- Interviewer
    Alright, so vibration and audio create that anticipation.
- Player 1
    Exactly! That anticipation, exactly, well put.
- Player 2
    Yes, and you can't cheat!
- Interviewer
    Did it seem like someone was cheating during the game?
- Player 2
    I cheated.
(player 1 laughs)
- Interviewer
    But is it cheating, or is it being a bit more...
- Player 2
    Yes, it's being a bit more cunning.
- Interviewer
    Then, before actually trying the Blind version of the game, did you have any expectations? Did you think it would be easier or more difficult? Did you know how your approach to the game might change, if at all?
- Player 1
    No, I didn't have high expectations, I mean, I didn't think it would be that different.
- Interviewer
    Okay, but it was different.
- Player 2
    Me too, me too.
- Interviewer
    Okay, do you think being blindfolded influenced your game performance?
- Player 2
    Yes, yes
- Interviewer
    Better?
- Player 2
    Definitely.
- Player 1
    She wasn't watching what I was doing, so yes.
- Interviewer
    Alright, then we'll see the result. Okay, last question: What was your favorite part of the system - including sound, audio, the glove... In its various components, what was your favorite and least favorite part?
- Player 2
    No, the fact that it vibrates is nice.
- Player 1
    Exactly. I would say the same, the fact that it vibrates is really nice.
- Interviewer   
    Okay, and least favorite?
- Player 2
    The sound of the hand.
- Interviewer
    Annoying?
- Player 1
    Exactly, exactly.
- Interviewer
    Okay, okay, fair enough. So, any suggestions on how to improve? Change that sound, I guess.
- Player 1
    I would say yes. The rest, no, I would say it's fine for me. I mean, it's okay as it is.
- Interviewer
    Anything else to add?
- Player 2
    No
- Interviewer
    Is that all?
- Player 1
    Yes, all good.
- Interviewer
    Thanks a lot!
