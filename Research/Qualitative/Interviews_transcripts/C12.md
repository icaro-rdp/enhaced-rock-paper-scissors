    Thank you. So, thanks for participating. We need three more questions to ask you. The first one will be… how did you feel in playing the blind version of the game compared to the not blind one? If you notice, any particular changes, please report them.
- Player 2
    Yeah, like when you're playing a blind game like you asked to get a bit late. Like you don't have to do it exactly on the queue. It's like you can. Maybe, like be late so it will be fine, but the other one then you feel guilty if you don't play tightly I feel.
- Player 1
    For me it was the same, honestly. Both versions.
- Interviewer
    OK, OK. So, no particular change? In the approach to the game? So, before actually playing them, did you have any expectation on what could have been changed between the two versions? Do you think you have been affected in playing blindfolded? 
- Player 2
    Yes
- Interviewer
    Yes, right. Your performances were better, worse?
- Player 2
    I am. I think it's the same, but like you feel… Like what do you call them. Like… the thought process is different...
- Interviewer
    Thought processes OK.
- Player 2
    Is different because it's not blinded and then you don't want to look at the other person's hand, and so you're looking at random things like no. OK, better.
- Player 1
    I think the same.
- Interviewer
    OK. OK. So, by not seeing the other players hand… Not being able to see other hands, you approach the game differently. OK, last question, what was your favorite part of the system considering the whole components? And the least favorite one?
- Player 2
    Ohh, the countdown was fun. (both laugh) One finding the sensors was difficult. Like, sometimes like after you first find it, then you're like using the first time to find it.
- Player 1 
    Hearing that I was always winning. (laugh)
- Interviewer
    Ok, you mean. That that one was a nice part. OK, any recommendation on how to improve these parts? 
- Player 1
    I don’t know enough about these stuff.
- Interviewer
    Really, anything, anything goes. Anything, anything you would like to implement if… I mean, there is.
- Player 2
    No, like maybe like, you know, easier way to, like, put the gloves in. But I know this is a prototype.
- Interviewer
    OK. OK. OK. I see. Thanks. Thanks for… Thanks for answering and thanks for participating.
