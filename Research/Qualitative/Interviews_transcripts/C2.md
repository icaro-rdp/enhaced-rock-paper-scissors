    So, I hope you had fun while playing. I hope it was, at least, strange to try, the different things to do. So, the first question… Maybe I ask first to you, then you answer. How did you feel playing the blind version of the game compared to the normal one? And, do you notice any particular change in doing that?
- Player 2
    It was a bit awkward for me because I'm not seeing my hands, so I did some movement wrong. But otherwise, it was, kind of the same, only this visual…
- Player 1
    OK.
- Interviewer
    On the other side?
- Player 1
    For me was kind of the same, I just felt… Having some troubles trying not to cheat.
- Interviewer
    Like in the blind or without. Without blindfold. OK.
- Player 1
    Because maybe you can see the opponent and then play, so I was trying to look somewhere else. But I didn't experience anything different from the two versions.
- Interviewer
    OK. OK. Thank you, then. We told you that there would have been the blind version and the normal version at the beginning before actually trying them, did you have any expectation? How do you think being blindfolded… I mean, you said it didn't affect your performances, but there were some different results. So, in the first one you won, maybe? And the second one, it was more even, do you think you were affected in the performance a bit?
- Player 1
    I didn't want to cheat, so I was like, I don't know, maybe it was, or maybe it wasn't. So, I don't know.
- Interviewer
    I see. I see. OK. OK. In your case, do you have any expectation? Do you think it affects the result?
- Player 2
    I accepted that when you're blindfolded, then you don't see the opponent, so it's going to be less predictable what they are doing than you.
- Player 1
    If you can see.
- Player 2
    See the opponent and maybe see their hands and not cheat.
- Interviewer
    OK, last question, what was your favorite part of the system, generally? So, the glove, the speaker, the distance sensor and do you have any recommendation on how to improve that? So, want to start?
- Player 2
    For me it was the integration of like a kind of digital game with actually doing the game and… and… reality. So, I really like the sound effects and everything. It was nice.
- Interviewer
    OK, also least favorite features. 
- Player 2 
    Being blindfolded.
- Interviewer
    OK, OK. OK, fine, it's fine. That's the feature of the game. Recommendation on how to possibly improve some aspects of the game?
- Player 2
    I'm not sure what's your goal in the end… So….
- Interviewer
    Sure, sure. But as a… as an experience… as the experience you had, so anything goes, if you have.
- Player 2
    I think I would put this to yours as well just. To make it equal. [referring to IR sensor positioned on the box]
- Interviewer
    I see. OK. OK.
- Player 2
    And also like I felt when the there is a tie, there's a bit of delay of like they are like saying it's very early and then, it’s different than when you win.
- Interviewer
    OK, thank you. On your side?
- Player 1
    For me, I. Like the, I like the gloves, the sound effects. Everything was fine to me. Look, I had fun playing this. Maybe the only thing is when you draw you can say “draw” instead of “no contest”. So, you can differentiate the two. OK then maybe for future work. If you guys want, maybe try, the Bluetooth or some other like wireless technology, yeah.
- Interviewer
    Yeah, yeah, should be definitely more ergonomic.
- Player 1
    Because I think it's fragile. Like they are realized very good. They can be fragile. Maybe you can integrate it also like doing an online game. Like people can and be in the blindfolded version. Maybe you can, put some VR stuff and having some effects of…
- Interviewer
    Several improvements, yeah.
- Player 1
    If this is your only work, not related to University, you can improve it a lot.
- Interviewer
    Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So, any further comments? Otherwise I will stop recording… OK.
