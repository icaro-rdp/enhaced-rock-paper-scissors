    OK. So, I mean, I hope you had fun playing. At least it seems from outside. I would like to ask first Constantine and then we change. How did you feel playing in the blind version of the game? OK, so compared to the normal game, how do you feel being blind while playing? Did you feel anything? Any particular change?
- Player 1
    Was with the feeling of novelty, and it was a little bit less coordinated for me in the beginning when we started to play the blind version, but then I got used to it. And I uumh... I think it was a wonderful experience and even more honest, from the gameplay experience point of view, because you cannot cheat or whatever, or you don't have the psychological obstacles which can make some, again, obstacles for the game.
- Interviewer
    OK, OK. So.
- Player 2
    Yeah, I found it, like, it's better than the not blindfolded one because: what he said, like we can't, we can't cheat. And obviously I think, you know, reading my mind, yeah, so we can avoid the ties. So, I thought the ties are less in the blindfolded one. So, I think I like the blindfolded one better and it was easy for me, yeah.
- Interviewer
    OK. OK. OK. Thank you. Yeah. So, I mean, we told you that there were the two modes before starting, did you have any expectations before, about the differences? Or you just discover while playing? And how do you think being blindfolded change your game performances? If that happens…
- Player 1
    I would say that initially I thought that the blindfolded glasses were related to 3D something. Initially when I saw them for the first time, but later I understood and it was just as my expectation, but I didn't expect that the results will be so different. But it was even easier to play just because you don't have the. Problem of for focusing your attention, you just hear the sounds and justice make the move, and then you hear the results and it's very, also, interesting to wait for the results in the end, to know what she have. But when you hear the sound, you understand that you lose so…
(everyone laughing)
- Interviewer
    OK, most of the time I see, I feel OK. Nice. So same. Yeah. You want me to repeat the question or? Fine. OK. So, did you have any expectation before starting to actually play blindfolded?
- Player 2
    Yeah, I thought it would be easy in blindfold. Yeah. So, I wouldn’t be able to see things like opposite player hand or other movements.
- Interviewer
    OK, good. Thanks. The last one, what was your favorite part of the system considering the IR sensors and the speakers? Or the gloves actually, what was your favorite and least favorite? And, any recommendation on how it could have been improved?
- Player 1
    The sounds were quite good, and they were quite funny, so they made a little bit of experience here. And I think that in general it was pretty much wonderful to have this experience, but my least favorite part was related to the gloves in the sense that they could be damaged. And I was a bit wondering how to not make the damage because they seem to be tight. But I think that in the future you will improve this. Just because this may be like a test. Yeah, a prototype. Yeah.
- Player 2
    For me the most favorite part was the sound, the winning sound.
(everyone laughs)
- Interviewer
    When you won, only!
(laughs)
- Player 2
    And maybe when we use the blindfold, maybe to make it more, it's also good, but make it better [referring to the IR sensors]. Maybe we can have a switch or something like this, yeah? 
- Interviewer
    OK. OK. OK, I see. OK, thanks. Any further comments, some last things, otherwise.
- Player 1
    Is it intended to help… To help with the people with disabilities or just for the gaming experience? What is the intention of the experiment?
- Interviewer
    Sorry, you want to know. OK, so I can stop there.
- Player 1
    Yeah, just.
