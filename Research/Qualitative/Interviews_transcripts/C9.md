    Some last questions that for data that we need. So, thank you for participating, first of all. How did you feel playing in the blind version, compared to the not blind one? Did you notice any particular change between the two?
- Player 2
    I think that the sound effects are more useful like this. And more interesting.
- Interviewer
    In the blind one, compared to the not blind.
- Player 2
    Yeah, because it makes this suspense to know who's winning. So, you don't know immediately.
- Player 1
    In the blind, you cannot... You cannot talk to his eyes.
- Interviewer
    OK.
- Player 2
    Sometimes people do it slowly, so they already get a fraction of chance to see the other guy, what is he going to do? And they might be able to cheat.
- Interviewer
    OK. Yeah, cheat. Or I mean, I don't know if I would consider that cheating.
- Player 1
    So, blind make you more commitment. Maybe it's clear game, OK. And more impressive.
- Interviewer
    OK, before actually trying the two different modalities. Did you have any expectation on how the game could have changed? And do you think that being blindfolded affected your game performances? Do you feel like you were better in one or the other?
- Player 2
    Yeah, I think it's more fair in the blind version, yeah.
- Player 1
    Yes, I like it. I thought I had to to, to decide my choice.
- Interviewer
    OK. OK, nice. So last question, what was your favorite part of the system considering the several components of audio, gloves?
- Player 2
    The sound effects.
- Player 1
    The vibration.
- Interviewer
    Vibration and sound effects. OK, all of them. There was. OK, nice.
- Player 2
    Yeah, yeah. And the sound…
- Interviewer
    Was nice, OK?
- Player 2
    Plays like an arcade game.
- Interviewer
    And do you have any? No. Also you have the least favorite part of the system.
- Player 2
    That's the sensor you have to take too long to join. Maybe you can put the button instead, yeah.
- Interviewer
    OK. Instead of that. OK. But was it hard to find or I mean, was it...
- Player 2
    When you blindfolded, yes, yeah.
- Interviewer
    Okok. Any recommendation on how to improve? Yeah, of course changing this…
- Player 1
    Cover for the hand. Hide the wires.
- Player 2
    Right.
- Interviewer
    Hide the wires
- Player 1
    Maybe make it wireless.
- Interviewer
    Yeah, wireless, making it more ergonomic, more easy, easy to wear and use.
