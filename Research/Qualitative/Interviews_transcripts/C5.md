    Then? First of all, thank you for participating, I hope you had a great time. I ask these last questions to gather the latest data we need. First question, I would like to ask you what it was like to play the blind version of the game, compared to the non-blind version? And if you've noticed any changes between them, please.
- Player 1
    I felt much calmer honestly, because being in person, you can't watch the players in a match and you can feel more oppressed... Also, I was able to figure out from the sound the hand made, then what move it was, what figure it was.
- Player 2
    More than the other, I found the difference, as F says, that there is no pressure to look each other in the eye, but also. With, with goggles. With these, let's say I left, I listened more to that, that voice, the unconscious, that told me what he could do.
- Interviewer
    OK.
- Player 2
    And I think maybe that's why too...
- Interviewer
    Instinctive, OK, all OK.
- Player 2
    More intuitive, more intuitive.
- Player 1
    Even more rational. Maybe it's more rational because you think about what you're going to do? How many times has he made this move? Maybe he'll want to do this.
- Interviewer
    That is, not, not seeing. OK.
- Player 2
    No, I did it by intuition.
- Interviewer
    On the contrary, OK. OK, understood, understood? Then, before we actually tried the two versions, when we told you that you would find, try both, did you have any expectations about what the changes might be? And do you think that being blindfolded has affected your performance? Say.
- Player 1
    Back then, my expectation was that it would be harder blindfolded. I honestly don't know why, but it's actually a lot easier in my opinion because you just have to think about your own moves instead of thinking about what the other person is going to do.
- Interviewer
    OK.
- Player 2
    Done? I think it also depends on the opponent, because there are people who feel more in awe when they have to look a person in the eye for a long time. And if we look at the results: that I won the non-blind one, he won the blind one, maybe the blind one was more difficult for me. Because it serves as an advantage, looking a person in the eye because they have to think more things, so they don't think so much about what they are choosing in my opinion.
- Interviewer
    Ok. OKOK get it? OK. Last question: of the whole system, of the various components of which it is composed, what was your favorite part? Your least favorite? And if you have any advice on how to improve.
- Player 1
    Least favorite part, it's not that I have so I don't know. I really liked the sound, the soundtrack is there. Also vibrations, as they are differentiated by the way. But I don't know, in my opinion the system works very well, I see everything as necessary.
- Player 2
    In my favorite part it was both the vibrations and the sensor, when we make the sound in unison, when there is the coordination between the two players. And the thing I liked the least: maybe the downtime that there is when you make the draws in the sounds and everything...
- Interviewer
    Ah well, especially because you've done enough?
(everyone laughs)
    Okok. Was there any difficulty in finding the sensor? In the end it's a matter of a few seconds, OK.
- Player 2
    No, no, no.
- Interviewer
    OK, well anything else to add? Okay, OK.
- Player 1
    I, I, would do it every day.
- Interviewer
    Then... Then... All right. Thank you very much, thank you very much!
