# Flex Control

This is a project that uses a flex sensor to control a game. The game is played in rounds, and the number of rounds won by each player is tracked.

## Variables

- `round_played`: The number of rounds that have been played.
- `a_wins`: The number of rounds won by player A.
- `b_wins`: The number of rounds won by player B.
- `button_pin`: The pin number where the button is connected.
- `button_state`: The current state of the button.
- `last_button_state`: The last state of the button.
- `round_total`: The total number of rounds to be played.
- `limit_value`: The limit value for the flex sensor.

## Setup

The setup routine runs once when you press reset. It initializes serial communication at 9600 bits per second and sets the button pin as an input.

## Functions

TBD - Describe the functions used in the code.
